What NHS Digital says about classpat 

"Regular attender episodes (classpat = â€˜3â€™ and â€˜4â€™) are considered as separate units of care that 
should not be linked to other episodes and therefore are excluded from the episode ordering criteria shown below â€“ they form single episode provider spells."

*This tabulation picks up cases where admission is zero but there are non zero cost because
*some admissions are rightly zero but for same individual can still have non-zero cost for their other admissions
*for those with admission==0 and nonzero_cost==1, there is no total cost figure because cost data are not ok
